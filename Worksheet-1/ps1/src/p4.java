/* Doctor says a man should weigh 106 pounds for the first 5 feet of height, plus 7 pounds for every inch
above that; a woman should weigh 100 pounds for the first 5 feet of height, plus 6 pounds for every inch
above that. Write a program that determines how much an individual person should weigh. Hereâ€™s what
your program might look like in action:
Sample Output:
Type 1 if you are female and 2 if male: How tall are you?
Number of feet : 5
Number of inches : 10
You should weigh 160 pounds
Type 1 if you are female and 2 if male: How tall are you?
Number of feet : 6
Number of inches : 0
You should weigh 190 pounds*/
